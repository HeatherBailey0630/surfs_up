# surfs_up
## Overview
Using PANDAS and SQLAlchemy, we explored temperature data from Oahu over the last year, and focused specifically on data from the months of June and December. Our purpose was to prove to the investor in our surf shop that Oahu has appropriate surfing weather year round, and would therefore be a successful enterprise. 
## Results
From our data, we discovered the summary statistics for the months of June and December
- June Temperatures: The average June temperature was about 75 degrees, which is optimal beach/surfing weather. The lowest temperature was 64 degrees, and the highest temperature was 85 degrees.

- December Temperatures: The average December temperature was about 71 degrees, which is still fantastic weather for the middle of winter. The lowest temperature was 56 degrees, and the highest temperature was 83 degrees. 56 degrees is not optimal, but would likely still be warm enough for the die-hard surfers out there.

- Analysis: It appears from our summary statistics from the months of June and December that Oahu has optimal weather year round, with only a small percentage of chilly days. It appears the surf shop would be a good investment, and it's unlikely that the weather will significantly negatively impact business. 

## Summary
From this data, we can make a variety of assumptions. We can show our investor that summer in Oahu has optimal weather, and winter still has great surfing weather, with the exception of a few chilly days. A further analysis would be required to ascertain if the months of November, January, and February are colder than December and may hinder business. We could also dive deeper into precipitation and clouds to determine the amount of sunny days in both winter and summer.
